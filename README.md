# Game Jam: 2022 July

We, a group of friend, made an improvised game jam over the course of one weekend.
The theme was randomly picked on [this website](https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/).

**Theme:** Running out of power.

**Duration:** 2 days

**Engine:** Godot 3.4 + GD Script

**Participants:**
- Jules SALA√è
- Maxence VANDRA
- Mikel-Ange BARROS
- Willy JACQUET

# Play

You download a build of the game (windows and linux) in the [release section](https://github.com/Garmogg/gj2207/releases/tag/gamejam).

# Post-Mortem

Unfortunately we ran out of time and couldn't integrate all we had done.
